# PCS-Project
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) classification and prediction in patients using Python models.

## Research question
Cardiovascular diseases account for almost 17.5 million deaths annually. Therefore, is there a way to detect, predict or classify the chances of the onset of the diseases early using past patient data?
In this project I train and test different models and see which ones perform accurately and can be implemented to improve the care of patients. 

## Libraries used
- Pandas version 1.2.2 <br>
- Numpy version 1.20.1 <br>
- Matplotlib version 3.3.4 <br>
- Seaborn version 0.11.1 <br>
- Scikit learn version 0.24.1 <br>
