# PCS-Project
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) classification and prediction in patients using Python models.

## Research question
Cardiovascular diseases account for almost 17.5 million deaths annually. Therefore, is there a way to detect, predict or classify the chances of the onset of the diseases early using past patient data?
In this project I train and test different models and see which ones perform accurately and can be implemented to improve the care of patients. 

## Libraries used
- Pandas version 1.2.2 <br>
- Numpy version 1.20.1 <br>
- Matplotlib version 3.3.4 <br>
- Seaborn version 0.11.1 <br>
- Scikit learn version 0.24.1 <br>

## Files
1. **PCS project on Cardiovascular diseases.ipynb** <br> Jupyter notebook containing all data preprocessing, analysis and model training and testing. <br>
2. **PCS project on Cardiovascular diseases.html** <br> A html version of the Jupyter notebook. All cells have been run and the output is visible. To view, please download it and open in a browser. <br>

## Datasets
1. **cardiovascular data.csv** <br> The raw dataset.
2. **clean_cardiodata.csv** <br> The cleaned data set with new features from the data preprocessing steps. <br>
3. **relevant_cardiodata.csv** <br> Dataset of the relevant data after feature selection <br>

## To run locally
1.	Download the zipped repository.
2.	Unzip the downloaded folder.
3.	Having already installed Jupyter notebooks on your machine, open the command line (cmd) and type “Jupyter notebooks” to start the kernel.
4.	Once the kernel is running and opens in the browser, navigate via the interface to where the repository is stored locally and open the .ipynb file.
5.	Run the first cell to install all necessary libraries then run all the other cells.

In the event you do not want to run the notebook locally, please use the .html document in the repository. It contains the Jupyter notebook with all the cells run with the output visible.
